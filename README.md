## Dataset Source üìÄ
The dataset used in this project is sourced from **Kaggle**, a widely recognized platform for datasets. This dataset provides comprehensive information on loan applications, borrower profiles, and loan performance metrics, making it ideal for conducting in-depth loan portfolio analysis.
## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) üìà
- **Total Loan Applications:** Measures the count of loan applications received, with Month-to-Date (MTD) and Month-over-Month (MoM) tracking.
- **Total Funded Amount:** Reflects the total funds disbursed as loans, along with MTD and MoM metrics.
- **Total Amount Received:** Tracks the repayments from borrowers, showing cash flow with MTD and MoM insights.
- **Average Interest Rate:** Monitors the average interest rate on loans to analyze lending costs.
- **Average Debt-to-Income Ratio (DTI):** Evaluates borrowers' financial health through the average DTI, with MTD and MoM fluctuations.
- **Good Loan vs. Bad Loan KPIs:**
    - **Good Loans:** Applications, Funded Amount, Received Amount.
    - **Bad Loans:** Application Percentage, Funded Amount, Received Amount.
